# Spring Security 6 with Spring Boot and JWT

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing security in web applications using Spring Security 6 with Spring Boot and JWT. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to secure your web applications by covering both fundamental and advanced topics such as OAuth2 and JWT.

## Importance of Security in Software Development

Securing web applications is essential, especially when they handle sensitive user data. Spring Security helps by providing a robust framework that includes a wide array of security features to protect your applications from various threats.

## Different Methods of Securing a Web Application
* **Username and Password Authentication**: The most common method.

* **OAuth2**: Allows third-party services like Google or GitHub to authenticate users.

* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Offers a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties.

Each method has its own advantages and is suitable for different scenarios based on the specific needs of your application.
## Technologies Used

* **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building web applications.

* **Spring Security**: Provides comprehensive security features for web applications.

* **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.

* **Maven**: A build tool for managing project dependencies.

* **Eclipse**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding.
